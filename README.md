# discord_bot_connector

This Bot can be added to a Discord server and is capable of reading messages from other bots, even when they are in Embed format. 

Full documentation for embed class etc is here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html?highlight=embed#discord.Embed

Bot can be edited to choose responses, and is also capable of responding to private messages.


Currently building out compability with Binance API using the python-binance package.
